Wikipedia Lookup Tool
=====================

This is a pure Javascript front end for looking up interlanguage links on 
Wikipedia. 


TODO:

1. Make it possible to restrict target language(s) through the URL 
2. Make app bookmarkable 
3. Add export (JSON, CSV, plaintext...)
4. Make source language editable 
5. Port to Backbone.js
6. Expand language codes somehow
7. Something else?

Want your own copy?
-------------------

Download a .zip directory by clicking: 

[https://github.com/amundo/wplookup/zipball/master](https://github.com/amundo/wplookup/zipball/master)

This will download a .zip file to your computer. Unzip that and open up `index.html` inside the 
resulting directory in your browser (`File > Open` on Firefox, for instance). Then it should work.

(If you know about `git` then you know how to clone a repo, blah blah.)

THANKS!
